# Welcome
Welcome to this repository! This program is designed for Mad Libs lovers.
### What's a 'Mad Lib'?
A Mad Lib is a story whose components have been taken apart and random alternatives inserted in. Trust me, it's more fun than it sounds, especially with friends!
## Files
```madlib.html``` includes a webpage with an input form, stories, and everything you need for a Mad Lib!
_more info coming soon!_
## Conclusion
I hope this program proves useful to you! Happy coding!

Note: this program works the most efficiently when stories are specifically coded to adapt to user input errors.
